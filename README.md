# Phase invariant convolutions
This folder contains the basic material to construct Harmonic Networks (HNs)
* train.py is the main entry point for our code
* harmonic_network_ops.py contains core HC implementations
* harmonic_network_helpers.py contains handy functions for using these
* harmonic_network_models.py contains the model definitions that allow to reproduce our results

Please note that this is work in progress, so pull often!

Todos which we have completed:
- [x] API for core HC functions
- [x] Easy rotated MNIST example

Todos which we are currently working on:
- [ ] Providing easy training code for our BSD experiments
- [ ] Providing multi-threaded reads for data-feeding
