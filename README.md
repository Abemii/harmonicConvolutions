# Harmonic Networks: Deep Translation and Rotation Equivariance

This branch is where we are preparing the camera ready code. We plan to sort out known issues and to include lightweight implementations of our experiments for:
[] Classification: MNIST-rot
[] Boundary Segmentation: BSD500
[] Introspective results: data ablation and response stability
