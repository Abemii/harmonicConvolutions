# Harmonic Networks: Deep Translation and Rotation Equivariance

> It appears there may be a bug in the core ops. Until we've figured it out, please trust all results with a pinch of salt.

> This code requires Tensorflow version 1.0

To run code for a specific experiment, run the file `run_<myscript>.py` in the relevant folder.

This branch is where we are preparing the camera ready code. We plan to sort out known issues and to include lightweight implementations of our experiments for:
- [ ] Classification: MNIST-rot
- [ ] Boundary Segmentation: BSD500
- [ ] Introspective results: data ablation and response stability
