# Phase invariant convolutions
This folder contains the basic material to construct NNs with rotational pooling. The scripts are:
* equivariant.py: main script to run
* steer_conv.py: contains the basic units for phase invariant pooling

* hyperopt.py: runs a 2 hyperparameter optimizers to optimize models in equivariant.py
* input_data.py: loads the .npz format datasets
