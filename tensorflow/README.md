# Phase invariant convolutions
This folder contains the basic material to construct NNs with rotational pooling. The scripts are:
* amat_loader: loads the MNIST-rot dataset and writes to numpy format
* example_scripts: contains the examples to run
* hyperopt: runs a hyperparameter optimizer
* input_data: loads the .npz format dataset
* rotated_conv: contains the basic units for phase invariant pooling
